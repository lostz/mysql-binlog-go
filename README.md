mysql-binlog-go
===============
Under development (DO NOT USE)

This library is designed for parsing mysql binary logs into structs that you can then manipulate in any way you want. I have no plans at this moment to support any versions of MySQL other than 5.6 (with v4 formatting and post 5.6.4 time variables).
